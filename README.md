🙋‍♂️ Hi there! My name is Matias Sagardia and I am a 27-year-old software developer from Argentina. 

💻 I have a strong foundation in front-end web development and I am currently expanding my skillset by learning JavaScript and React. 

⚡I have worked with HTML, CSS, and Sass, as well as the popular front-end framework Bootstrap. 

💥 I am passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites and web applications. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
